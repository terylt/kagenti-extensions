// HandleTransparentConn processes one outbound connection captured by an
// iptables REDIRECT (proxy-sidecar enforce-redirect mode). It is the
// transparent-listener analogue of handleConnect, and shares its semantics:
// the same outbound pipeline gates the connection on destination/identity, and
// the bytes are then blind-tunnelled, preserving the agent's end-to-end TLS
// (token-exchange and protocol parsers are no-ops on opaque TLS, exactly as on
// the CONNECT path).
//
// The crucial difference from handleConnect: there is NO HTTP CONNECT request.
// The agent believes it is talking directly to dst, so the proxy must emit no
// protocol bytes back — no "200 Connection Established", no hijack. It simply
// gates, dials dst, and copies bytes both ways. dst is "host:port" recovered
// from SO_ORIGINAL_DST by the transparent listener.
//
// HOSTNAME RECOVERY: CONNECT carries a hostname in r.Host, but SO_ORIGINAL_DST
// yields only an IP:port. To give host/domain egress policy parity with the
// CONNECT path, we sniff the connection's first bytes for the destination name
// — the TLS ClientHello SNI for HTTPS, or the HTTP Host header for plaintext
// HTTP — and use it as pctx.Host. If neither can be recovered we fall back to
// the IP. The dial target ALWAYS stays the SO_ORIGINAL_DST IP (dst); the name is
// only the policy key.
//
// Trust caveat (relevant before enforce-redirect goes always-on): for captured
// traffic the agent controls both the SNI/Host and, separately, the IP the
// bytes actually go to, so a *malicious* agent could present an allowed name
// while connecting to another IP. Name-based policy here is therefore reliable
// against a cooperative/misconfigured agent (the motivating case) but is not a
// hard control against a hostile one — only the IP is ground truth. Hard
// enforcement would need IP-set allowlists or SNI/cert cross-checks.
//
