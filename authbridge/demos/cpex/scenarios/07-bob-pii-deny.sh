# Bob (HR, perm.email_send) tries to send an email whose body
# carries an SSN-like pattern. APL's coarse `require(perm.email_send)`
# passes (Bob has the perm), but the PII scanner plugin walks the
# args, detects the SSN pattern, and denies the call.
#
# This demonstrates a field-level plugin in action — caught BEFORE
# the email backend is touched. The audit-logger plugin still emits
# its observation record for the deny, so operators see the event.
#
# Expected:
#   * HTTP 200 + JSON-RPC error -32001, data.violation=`pii.detected`
#     (gateway denials use the MCP Tools-spec JSON-RPC error envelope,
#     not HTTP 4xx)
#   * Backend (hr-mcp) NEVER receives the call — the deny is
#     enforced at the gateway plugin layer
#   * stderr (from the gateway process) shows a JSON audit record
#     describing the denied send_email attempt
